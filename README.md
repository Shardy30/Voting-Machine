# Voting-Machine

This is a Voting Machine application made using MATLAB which runs only if the machine has MATLAB installed on it.

It takes its data from the Databases folder inside the main folder. The entries are taken from an excel file whereas images are taken directly from their location inside the databases folder.


## Running The App

The main folder contains 3 MATLAB app files for the GUI and Processing and a folder named Databases to provide data for the app files. 

Only the VotingMachine.mlapp file has to be run since it’s the main file and gives arguments to others to display certain screens. The other two can’t run on their own due to lack of Arguments.



## Demo and Screenshots

When we run the VotingMachine.mlapp file, we get to see the following screen - 

If Vote button against any of the party is pressed, the vote gets recorded and the voting state turns off for 4 seconds after giving the user a visual and audio feedback.

When the reselts need to be checked, a predefined password has to be entered by the admin only after which the results would be visible.

The result screen contains various information and looks something like this - 

The Candidate names, parties and all other infos are modifiable and it can be done in the Databases folder. Remember that the party logo must have same name as the party with .jpg extension.
